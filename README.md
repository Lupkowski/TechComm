## FAQ  
**Why is Markdown better than writing raw HTML?**  
Markdown and HTML are two common markup languages. However, Markdown is a simple, lightweight easy to learn language compared to the more complex HTML. Markdown uses a minimalistic form for syntax that resembles plain text. HTML makes use of tags to format text which can make the language harder to learn and harder to read.  

**I changed the Markdown version of my resume, so why donâ€™t I see the changes when I refresh the website in my browser?**  
Static websites do not update automatically when a change has been made. You need to recompile your site and push the changes to your repository then redeploy your website for it to update.  
*Recompile:* pelican content -o output -s pelicanconf.py  
*Commit the changes:* ghp-import output -b gh-pages  
*Push the update to the site:* git push origin gh-pages
